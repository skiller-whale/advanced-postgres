|    * Uncomment the SELECT statement and check if your prediction was right.
|      (any blocked operations will complete after 2 seconds instead of 1).
|
|    * On the line below the SELECT from employees statement, add a new SQL
|      statement that will also block the index creation in the other
|      transaction (but not the UPDATE).
|
|    * On the line below that, add another SQL statement that will also block
|      the update in the other transaction. Think about which table lock modes
|      would block the update, and choose a statement based on this.
